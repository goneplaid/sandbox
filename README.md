# Sandbox

This is a little sandbox project that I created for storing the results of various coding challenges from sites like Hackerrank that I've completed in JavaScript.

It also contains some other fun little coding challenges, like finding the longest palindrome in a string of random characters (how fun!) and sorting different arrays in various ways (how fun!).

## Cool story, bro. Who are you?

I'm Shawn Wilson and I'm a 20 year veteran web developer! I'm actually referred to as a UX Engineer these days, but I digress.

Anyway, I hear all the kids these days are doing coding challenges for job interviews.

I recently decided to take some time off of work to refocus myself and will be re-entering the job market again soon, so I thought Iâ€™d brush up on some fundamentals and see what these coding challenges are all about.

As a result of cosmic circumstances, I only have one major publicly facing project that I've worked on, [the John Deere Prescription Creator](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eM8g9sytxLE) by Agrian, Inc., a previous employer of mine. Otherwise, the bulk of work over the years is now the private, intellectual property of the various companies that have employed me over the years.
