# Sandbox

This is a little sandbox project that I created for storing the results of the 30 Days of Coding challenge from Hackerrank, which I’m working on in JavaScript.

It also contains some other fun little coding challenges, like finding the longest palindrome in a string of random characters (how fun!) and sorting different arrays in various ways (how fun!).

## Cool story, bro. Who are you?

I'm Shawn Wilson and I'm a 20 year veteran web developer! I actually style myself a UX Engineer these days, but I digress.

Anyway, I hear all the kids these days are doing coding challenges for job interviews!

I recently decided to take some time off from work to refocus myself and will be re-entering the job market again soon. I thought I’d brush up on some fundamentals and see what these coding challenges are all about.

I have a tiny site at [http://shiny-pixels.dev](http://shiny-pixels.dev) where you can find my resume and a few other things. Have a wonderful day!
